This is a game made by Steven Kolln in which two players shoot fireballs at each other. Whoever is the last standing is the winner! The file game contains the file with the main method. Compile the game file with a java compiler and run from there. Some future changes include:
	1. Adding another thread for each to player to prevent interfering keystrokes.
	2. Adding a main menu screen.
	3. Adding a score on the side.
	4. Making the terrain affect gameplay. (ex: dirt slows movement)
	5. powerups
	6. Allow key rebinding
	
Controls for Player1: up=W right=D left=A down=A fire=Space
Controls for Player2: up=Up arrow right=Right arrow left=Left arrow down=Down arrow fire=Zero (num pad)

Game notes: players have three health. Only two fireballs can be active per player! Be sure to stratagize!
